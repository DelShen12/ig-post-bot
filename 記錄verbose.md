## 最終結果
The provided code is designed to automate the process of posting on Instagram. It begins by importing the necessary libraries, including `instaloader`, `os`, `time`, and `googletrans`. An instance of `Instaloader` is initialized, and functions are defined for logging into Instagram, uploading photos, and retrieving popular tags for a given caption. The user is prompted to provide their Instagram username, password, the path to the photo they want to upload, and the caption for the photo. The code then logs into Instagram, uploads the photo with the initial caption, retrieves popular tags for the caption, adds these tags to the caption, and re-uploads the photo with the updated caption. Finally, a success message is printed.
